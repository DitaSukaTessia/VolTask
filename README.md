# VolTask

## Overview

VolTask is a lightweight backend application designed to manage tasks with a structured status workflow system (pending, active, done, blocked). Built as a practical exercise in developing service layer logic and CRUD operations without a user interface, VolTask emphasizes data validation, business logic enforcement, and clean architectural patterns. This project serves as a foundation for understanding how task management systems operate at the backend level, with a focus on reliability and maintainability.
